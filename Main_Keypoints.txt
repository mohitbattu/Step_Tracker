Stateful widget:
A stateful widget is dynamic: for example, 
it can change its appearance in response to 
events triggered by user interactions or when 
it receives data. Checkbox, Radio, Slider, InkWell, 
Form, and TextField are examples of stateful widgets. 
Stateful widgets subclass StatefulWidget.
StateLessWidget:
A stateless widget never changes.
Icon, IconButton, and Text are examples of 
stateless widgets. Stateless widgets subclass 
StatelessWidget.

Scaffold:
Scaffold is a class in flutter 
which provides many widgets or we can say APIs 
like Drawer, SnackBar, BottomNavigationBar, 
FloatingActionButton, AppBar etc. Scaffold will 
expand or occupy the whole device screen. It will occupy 
the available space. Scaffold will provide a framework 
to implement the basic material design layout of the 
application.
